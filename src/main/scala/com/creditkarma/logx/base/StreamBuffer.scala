  * StreamBuffer is the abstraction of buffered data during streaming
  * SparkRDD and SparkDataset are the ideal implementation of this abstraction
  * They not only supports buffering in scalable fashion, but also supports transformation out of the box
  * Right now, it's unclear what the general interface exactly looks like,
  * so the trait is empty and the implemention would simply expose the RDD (Dataset) object to transformer and writer,
  * since RDD supports distributed transformation and write actions
